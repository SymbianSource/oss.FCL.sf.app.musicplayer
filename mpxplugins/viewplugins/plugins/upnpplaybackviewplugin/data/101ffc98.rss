// RESOURCE DEFINITIONS 

/**
 * The opaque_data syntax is made up of three parts: 
 * a list of Uids for resolving the view plugin, feature flags, priority.
 * 
 * <p>uid1;uid2;uid3</p>
 *  uid*: uid of the supported Playback/Collection plugin.
 *  E.g. if the view plugin supports Local Playback plugin, the list of
 *  uids will be: 0x101FFC06
 *
 * <t>uid</t>
 *  uid: plugin type uid.
 *  E.g. if the view plugin supports playback type, uid will be: 0x101FFCA0
 *
 * <f>flags</f> [optional]
 *  flags: sum of the required feature flags that listed in mpxviewplugin.hrh. 
 *  E.g. if the view plugin needs to be pre-loaded and it's user-selectable,
 *  then flags = KMPXVpFeaturePreLoaded + KMPXVpFeatureUserSelectable = 0x0003.
 *
 * <i>priority</i> [optional]
 *  priority: a value of type TMPXViewPluginPriorities. This value determines
 *  which view plugin will be resolved when several plugins can support the 
 *  same set of Uids. 
 *  Default value of this field is EMPXViewPluginPriorityNormal.
